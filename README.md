## Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project Overview
In my recent project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of Maven Roasters' sales data, a fictitious coffee shop chain with three bustling locations across New York City. Armed with data and determination, my goal was to unearth actionable insights that would empower Maven Roasters to make informed business decisions and drive growth.

### Project Goals:
- Sales Trend Analysis: I aimed to dissect the sales trends of Maven Roasters over time, identifying patterns and fluctuations to better understand the ebb and flow of their business.
-  Peak Business Days Investigation: By analyzing transaction records, I sought to determine which days of the week were busiest for Maven Roasters and delve into the factors contributing to this trend.
- Product Performance Evaluation: Through meticulous examination of product-level data, I aimed to identify the top-selling and least-favored items, as well as pinpoint products driving the highest revenue for the business.

### Business Model:
Maven Roasters operates under a customer-centric business model, offering a diverse range of high-quality coffee products across its three prime locations in NYC. With a focus on delivering exceptional customer experiences, Maven Roasters strives to cater to the diverse tastes and preferences of its clientele while maintaining a competitive edge in the bustling coffee market.

### Approach:
1. Data Preparation: I meticulously cleaned and prepared the transaction data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for subsequent analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing Excel, I conducted in-depth EDA to uncover insights and trends within the dataset.
3. Pivot Tables and Charts: Employing pivot tables and charts, I visualized key metrics and trends, providing stakeholders with intuitive and actionable insights.
4. Dashboard Creation: Finally, I synthesized my findings into a dynamic dashboard, offering stakeholders a comprehensive overview of Maven Roasters' performance metrics and actionable insights at a glance.
Key Findings:
Sales Trends: The analysis revealed a notable peak in sales during the morning hours, particularly between 7 am to 10 am, indicating a significant morning rush for Maven Roasters. Additionally, sales are highest on Mondays, closely followed by Fridays.
Peak Business Days: Mondays emerge as the busiest day for Maven Roasters, likely driven by the start of the workweek and customers seeking their caffeine fix. Fridays also see high sales activity, possibly as patrons wind down for the weekend.
Product Performance: Among Maven Roasters' offerings, coffee and tea stand out as the top-selling products, capturing the majority of sales. In contrast, packaged chocolate exhibits lower sales compared to other products, indicating potential areas for targeted marketing or product refinement.

By leveraging data-driven insights, Maven Roasters can refine their strategies, optimize operations, and ultimately enhance their competitive position in the thriving NYC coffee scene.
